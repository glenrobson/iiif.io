## About

While IIIF has focused primarily on Image based content, there has always been interest around the community in extending the paradigm to include Video and Audio resources, following the same [design principles][design-principles] as existing IIIF specifications.

The IIIF A/V Technical Specification Group aims to extend to A/V the benefits of interoperability and the growing ecosystem of clients and servers that IIIF provides for images. The A/V specification group was formed following a workshop hosted by the British Library to gather [use cases for extending IIIF to audio and video][bl-workshop-2016-04], and discussion at the [2016 IIIF Conference][iiif-conf-2016] in New York City. At the Fall 2016 working meeting in The Hague, the group focused on determining an initial set of features. The A/V group welcomes contributions to their collection of [audiovisual user stories][av-user-stories] and mockups and prototypes.

The [IIIF A/V charter][av-charter] provides an outline and timeline for anticipated work.
