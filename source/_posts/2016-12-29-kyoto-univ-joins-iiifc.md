The Kyoto University Library Network has officially joined the IIIF Consortium, expanding the reach of IIIF activities in Japan. An announcement is also available in [Japanese][japanese-bulletin].

In a recent [bulletin][bulletin], the Library Network announced that work is underway to digitize items from a collection of over 6.9 million rare and important cultural heritage materials, including rare manuscripts and books, "in order to help preserve them and to contribute to academic and cultural development at the same time. With IIIF technologies, we expect that we can enhance the user experience of image presentation and image interoperability."

The [Kyoto University Digital Library Rare Materials Exhibition][kuln-diglib] contains a multitude of compelling images of historical records, colored illustrations, important National Treasure artifacts, astronomy drawings, maps, and more, all soon to be made available with IIIF technology.

Welcome, and congratulations to the Kyoto University Library Network!
